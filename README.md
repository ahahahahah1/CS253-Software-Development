## Project

The project was to create an app that digitalizes customer and vendor interactions at IITK. The project has been very formally completed with complete documentation including the following documents:
* Software Requirement Specification
* Software Design Document
* Software Implementation Document
* Software User Manual

The envisioned version of the software is in the `proposed` directory whereas the `final` directory contains the final version of the documents with details of the implemented software. The `final` directory additionally contains a *Change Log* that details the changes made in the documents.

The frontend and backend implementations can be found in the `frontend` and `backend` directory respectively with steps to setup the system in the README file inside each directory. 

The main repository used during the development phase to enable collaborative work can be found here: [frontend](https://github.com/cs253-team2/frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/cs253-team2/backend).

## Assignments
The problem statements for the assignments in brief are (the complete problem statements can be found in the respective directory):
